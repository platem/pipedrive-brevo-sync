- [x] **Unit 1: Refactor: Move Filter Loading to Layout**: Created `+layout.server.ts` with Pipedrive filter sync logic (upsert, soft-delete handling), returns `{ filters }` to all (app) routes. Removed redundant `+page.server.ts` from dashboard, added placeholder file for future auth checks. _(Note: Filters from layout are available to child pages via `data.filters` without explicit prop drilling)_

- [x] **Unit 2: Pipedrive Service Extension**: Added `PipedriveDeal` and `PipedrivePerson` types from API docs. Implemented `getDealsByFilter(filterId)` with cursor-based pagination (100/page). Implemented `getPersons(personIds)` with batched lookups (100 IDs per request, no throttling needed). Orchestrator handles deduplication (`[...new Set()]`) and deal-to-person mapping. _(Note: Replaced individual `getPerson()` with batched `getPersons()` for efficiency)_

- [x] **Unit 3: Brevo Service Creation**: Created `src/lib/server/services/brevo.service.ts` with `BrevoContact` type, `createList(name)` → `{ id }`, `emptyList(listId)` using `all: true` param, and `importContacts(listId, contacts)` with 50-batch import. _(Note: Response body must be consumed with `await response.json()` even when unused to prevent connection pool exhaustion and memory leaks)_
