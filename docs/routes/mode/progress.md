- [x] **Unit 1: Refactor: Move Filter Loading to Layout**: Created `+layout.server.ts` with Pipedrive filter sync logic (upsert, soft-delete handling), returns `{ filters }` to all (app) routes. Removed redundant `+page.server.ts` from dashboard, added placeholder file for future auth checks. _(Note: Filters from layout are available to child pages via `data.filters` without explicit prop drilling)_
